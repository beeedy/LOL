This repo contains random side projects relating to Leauge of Legends. These projects aren't deserving of their own repos and share a similar theme of being based around League of Legends. Right now the projects included are:
1. aramPredict - A project for predicting the enemy team comp in ARAM's while still in the champ select team. Makes the assumption that this mode is not as 'random' as Riot would like you to believe. 
2. nameFinder - A simple script to find and list available summoner names starting with the shorted and moving in alphabetical order.
